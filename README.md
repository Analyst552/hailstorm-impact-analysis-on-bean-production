# hailstorm-impact-analysis-on-bean-production
The purpose of this project is to advice the farmers in western region which receives heavy rainfall on the best measures on bean production for high yields.
As a trainee on attachment at NRI KALRO Kakamega, i begun by visiting the filed where the beans experiments were laid.
I participated in laying and designing the experiment together with my fellow members under supervison of madam Shila.
The type of designs used in the field was randomized incomplete block design (RCBD) for 468 different varietis of beans. The experiment design was laid in a sapentine way in different blocks in each plot.
We later came and collected data on different diseases like Common bacteria bright (CBR), Anthracnose ... we analysed this using R and Python using Chi-square test to check the disease inheritance and device on how to come up with best disease resistance variety through breeding process.
We also collected Hilstorm data and analysed the effects on the production of beans based on different parts: stem strength, girth, vegetativeness and flowerbud abortion; we analysed this data through R and made a report.
